# High-Order-Component
A Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React.js is a design pattern used to enhance or reuse component logic. It is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with additional functionality or props. HOCs are commonly used for tasks like code reuse, state manipulation, and enhancing UI components.
